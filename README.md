1. Standardization -  Scaling the values by keeping in mind that the scaled values MUST have a Mean of 0  and SD of 1.
   where to apply : 1) Linear Regression Models 2)KNN 3)K Means 4) PCA 5) Artificial Neural Networks 6)Gradient Descent Algorithns
   
2. Function Transformer : Used log transformer and learned how it helps in making data more accurate to predictions 
also learned what's normalized data and with the help of LogisticRegression and DecisionTree Classifier Models , I learned to have a rough overview on MODELS !!
